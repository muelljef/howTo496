    <h2>Get an Amazon Web Services (Free Tier) account</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>First navigate to the AWS free tier website. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">Amazon Free Tier Sign Up Page</a></li>
      <li>Then click to go to the "Sign up for an AWS account" and follow the directions for signing up.</li>
      <li>Once you have an account log in to your account.</li>
      <li>
        There are five steps to follow to better secure your account. Navigate to the Identity Access Management module
        to setup your security. When you first sign in Amazon will indicate that these steps are not done with red X's rather
        than the green check marks I have.
      </li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Delete Your root access keys. This is not as scary as it sounds. This step simply deletes the root access keys
          to the AWS command line tools through the root account. You really DON'T need root access through the command
          line tools for this tutorial, and Amazon doesn't believe you need it in general at all. So delete the keys for
          now. If you ever really do need them you can re-issue them. It is important to note at this point you are logged
          in through the web console as the root user. You can access all services including the billing statements. In
          another step we will setup a user so you don't have to login as the root user all the time. So in deleting the
          root access keys you haven't deleted the root user access overall, just the command line access.
        </li>
        <li>
          Activate MFA on your root account. Click on the link in the drop down and follow the steps to setup your
          Multifactor authentication of your root account. It is important to do this because there are bitcoin miners out
          there looking to get access to your account. This is an extra security measure to help. You can have them simply
          send you a code through a text message or use something like the Google Authenticator App.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create individual IAM users. Here we want to create a Power User through IAM so that you have a user with the
          privileges you need to launch an EC2 instance, but not having to do this through the root account access. The
          idea is, the less you access the root account, the less you expose it to the world. If a hacker gets hold of
          your power user account you can kill it with your root account. If they get hold of your root account you will
          need to contact Amazon to stop the bleeding.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Click on the Manage Users button.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click on the Create New Users button on the User Management page. (You can see I have a user already created)
          </li>
          <li>
            Then add the user name you wish to use and click create in the bottom right corner. If you will have multiple
            users you can add extra users on the extra lines provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            After creating the user you will be taken to a page where the users 'key' credentials have been created. You
            will need to download these security credentials now. These are the private encryption keys the user will need
            in order to use any AWS command line tools.

            Save these somewhere. We will not need these for the tutorial, but you may want them for future use.

            If you lose the key or believe it is compromised you can inactivate the key and create a new one.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Use groups to assign permissions. Here is where you define a group and the access permissions. So we will make a
          developers group with Power User access. This will allow the user that we create (and will use) to launch
          an EC2 instance which we will use as our webserver.
        </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Click on the Manage Groups button
            </li>
            <li>
              Click on the Create New Group button in the upper left hand corner
            </li>
            <li>
              Give the group a name such as "Developers"
            </li>
            <li>
              Select a policy type for the group. You can attach multiple policies if you'd like and if you create
              custom policies beforehand you can assign those policies to the group. This essentially sets the services
              the user can access such as EC2, S3 or any other Amazon service you see in the main dashboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will search for and set the group to have PowerUser access which is a standard AWS (Notice I have entered
              'PowerUser' in the search box to filter the results). Select the PowerUserAccess and click on the Next Step
              button in the bottom right corner
            </li>
            <li>
              Then on the Review Page click on the Create Group Button
            </li>
            <li>
              You will be taken back to the groups page and there you will see your new group. In my case it's called developers.
              Click on the group now so we can add our user
            </li>
            <li>
              On the developers group page select the Add Users to Group button to add your user to this group.
            </li>
            <li>
              The page will show you a list of your users that you can make selections to add to the group. In this case
              I have only 1 (as I deleted my previous S3User). Once you have selected your user, click on the Add Users
              button in the bottom right hand corner.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>
          Apply an IAM password policy. This is a good idea to set. It's very straightforward. Click on the link in the
          dropdown and set a policy that you wish to enforce. This can require that user passwords are minimum 8 characters,
          have at least one non-alphanumeric character, passwords last only X amount of months, can't re-use old passwords,
          and other options that are all very easy to set. If you are going to have more that just yourself access the
          account this is an import policy to set.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extra Step: Customize the sign in link
        </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              From the IAM Dashboard page (with all Amazon's 5 steps to secure your account) Select the 'Customize' link to
              right of the "IAM users sign-in link"
            </li>
            <li>
              Then on the popup window set the Account Alias. Here we have set 'howtoawslaravel'. Warning the account alias
              can only contain digits, lowercase letters, and hyphen. Then click create.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will see the new link that the user you created can now sign in through. Note the root user must sign
              in through a different page. If you navigate to this page AWS provides a link to click on to sign in with
              your root user account if you need it.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <h2>Launch an EC2 Instance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sign into your PowerUser account through your IAM users sign-in link
      </li>
      <li>
        When you sign up to Amazon you will by default be put into their US Northwest availability zone, which is natural
        as Amazon has its headquarters in Seattle. Amazon has availability zones around the world and if you want your
        application to be served by somewhere closer to you, you should switch availability zones in the upper right
        hand corner and launch your EC2 instance from that zone and the EC2 instance is tied to a specific availability
        zone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now that we have our preferred availability zone set we are ready to launch the EC2 instance. Navigate to the
        EC2 Dashboard from the main dashboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the blue 'Launch Instance' button in the middle of the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS in the middle of the page
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the t2.micro (free tier eligible) Instance. This determines the CPUs and RAM your instance will have. If you
        have larger computing requirements you will have to choose an more powerful instance, but you will also have to pay
        for it (see the Amazon documentation for pricing details). Click 'Next: Configure Instance Details'
      </li>
      <li>
        On the configure Instance Details Page there are a number of options to set. We will use all of the standard
        options. I will explain each option as best I can.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The number of instances is straight forward. Here we only want 1. Increasing this, will increase the number
            of EC2 instances you launch. Free tier usage only allows for 1 instance
            running for about a month. So if you launched 2 at the start of the month and had them running for the full month
            they you would have to essentially pay for the 2nd one. (Free tier usages allows for 750 hours of EC2 instance
            usage).
          </li>
          <li>
            Purchasing option: Request Spot instances. This is done generally to lower the bill. This may be used where you
            are process large amounts of data that can be broken up into different processing parts and are not urgent.
            Essentially you can run an instance at lower cost when their is lower activity on Amazon. I think this has
            applications with non urgent big data calculations. Maybe DNA sequencing would be done using this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Network. On newer Amazon accounts, Amazon has something called a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). This is just a logically
            isolated section of Amazon Web Services. This helps to keep your servers (ec2 instances) separate from other
            account servers (that exist on the same hardware) and if you need it you can setup multiple VPC's and
            separate sets of servers that may be running different applications. We will use the default VPC setup by
            Amazon for now as the VPC setup and configuration is another topic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Subnet. The subnet setting allows you to set your subnet to any of the specific Amazon subnets for the
            availability zone that you are in or if you leave it as no preference Amazon will randomly and automatically
            assign your instance to one of its subnets. Here it is easy enough just to leave the setting as default.
          </li>
          <li>
            Auto-assign Public IP. We will choose 'Use subnet setting (Enable)' for this choice. Essentially your instance
            will be assigned an IP address automatically from Amazon's pool of public IP addresses. If you disable this
            you will need to go through the steps in the Elastic IP address section to set up your instance's public IP
            address if you need one.
          </li>
          <li>
            IAM role. We will leave this as none. Roles are used as a way to manage security and access between different
            Amazon resources. You may want your EC2 instance to access an S3 bucket or a database set up with Amazon RDS
            (Relational Database Service). You can set roles so they have access to use S3 or RDS. This allows you to manage
            the access through roles rather then setting up public private key pairs for encryption between instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shutdown behavior. Here I will select stop as the shutdown behavior. As I am using on instance for my program
            on the free tier I may want to start and stop the instance to prevent from going over my free tier usage. If you
            are setting up a system that automatically spins up an instance if one goes down you will likely want the
            shutdown behavior to be set as terminate. When the instance is shutdown it is then termintated and all data
            on the instance is lost. With these systems you will need to us EBS (storage) or S3 buckets to store database
            information or other resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            I will leave the Protect against accidental termination off. Essentially this requires an extra step to terminate
            your EC2 instance. If you turn it on and at some point want to terminate your instance you have to disable
            the feature before being able to terminate the instance. This may be more useful when there are multiple users
            and some are using command line features where they might send terminate commands to multiple instances (which
            may accidentally catch yours if the features is not on).
          </li>
          <li>
            The last two options will incur extra charges if you change the settings so I suggest leaving them as is for
            the tutorial (and use them only if you need them for your application). Changing the tenancy to Dedicated can
            increase the cost significantly.
          </li>
          <li>
            The one thing we do want to change or inspect on this page is the "Advanced Details" section which we will need
            to click on the dropdown to view. Here we can enter a bash script that will be run as the root user at startup.
            Since it is the root user we will make sure we don't use 'sudo' when running the script. The following is the
            snippet that I will add to my instance before launching just to install a few packages that we need such as git,
            php5, and apache2. I've added this as text, but you can add it as a file to be run.
          </li>
          <li>
            The next step is to add or adjust your storage. Again here as I don't need a database for the application I am
            pulling I will not set up any extra storage. If you need persistent storage this would bea good point to add the
            storage. When an instance is terminated the volume associated with root will be terminated as well, but any
            additional volumes that have been added will remain and can be managed through Elastic Block Store (in the
            EC2 dashboard). The click on Next: Tag Instance
          </li>
          <li>
            Tag Instance. Here is a good place to give the instance some tags so that you know what you have set it up for
            in case you end up generating many instances. Click on Next: Configure Security Group
          </li>
          <li>
            Configure Security Group. This is an important step. Here we set how your instance is being accessed. Since
            we want this to act like a web server we will add HTTP and HTTPS so that the web pages can be accessed and SSH
            so that we can login to the server and do some configuration. Since the SSH comes up by default lets configure
            that setting to me more secure by selecting the source dropdown on the far right and choosing My Ip. Amazon will
            put your current Ip into the source table. (Note if you have a dynamic IP address you may have to change this
            through the Amazon Console later if your IP changes, but this is a better option than leaving the SSH access open
            to the world for access. Allowing access to 0.0.0.0/0 would allow anyone to attempt to login and could leave
            your instance open to a brute force attack.) Then we will want to add two more rules setting the first to HTTP
            and the second to HTTPS. The standard settings will suffice. Then click on Review and Launch
          </li>
          <li>
            Review and Launch. Here look over your instance details and make sure you are happy with your choices. Then
            launch the instance. It may take a few minutes to launch the instance. I have found it to be very quick most
            of the time. IMPORTANT. Make sure to create and download the private key file. We will need this file to log
            into the server through ssh.
          </li>
